                It happens to everyone: death of a relative or friend, job loss, severed relationships, financial issues, marital disputes, and the list goes on.
            Suffering comes in many forms and affects us each in different ways. We tend to compensate by engaging in self destructive behaviors that further damage
            our being; our "soul" if you will. However, there is immense value in times of debilitating turmoil that can strengthen our character in order
            to proceed to the next chapter in our lives and pick up where we left off. This is the story of my rock bottom. DISCLAIMER: I am currently a work in progress!

        <article>
            <p class="paragraph">
                A brief history of the past 13 years(I'm currently 31), beginning
            at age 18. I didn't take high school seriously, although I was more
            than capable of receiving excellent grades, I was more concerned about
            partying with my friends and not worried about the future in front of me.
            Fast forward five years to when I was 23 and my girlfriend at the time (now wife)
            while I was content working meaningless, dead end jobs with no educational
            background. Still partying, still not caring. Fast forward another five years to age 28.
            I'm beginning to see the affects of being naive about my future.

            <p class="paragraph">
                Engaged with a wedding to plan in nine months, I enter engineering school as 
            a part time student and do just enough to get by. Then reality hits me like a
            brick wall with the birth of my daughter at age 30. While we were not 
            at poverty, I definately didnt have enough to afford to buy my daughter a 
            birthday cake for her first birthday. THAT was my rock bottom. So embarassed and 
            ashamed by myself by my lack of planning for the future, I vowed to never
            experience that feeling again. This is when Launchcode came into my life.

                Although I was studying mechanical engineering, it wouldn't be for another 3 years until
            graduation and then find a well paying job. I simply could not wait that long.
            My wife,daughter, and own self worth depended on it. You see, the point of
            this brief story is to bring to light that ignoring problems that aren't immediately clear only
            become bigger entities if not properly addressed. It's as if the blinders
            were taken off and I can finally see the damages that I've done to myself
            and the people I care about the most. Moving forward, I'm estatic to have
            the opportunity to learn such a valuable and sought after skill in computer programming.
